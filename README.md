## KMS-V1.0(Klipper Multi-Color System)  
(Compatible with BigTreeTech MMB-Board (Beta))  
KMS-V1.0 is an automatic consumables changer based on the Klipper system, designed for multi-color 3D printing.   
As a fully open-source device, it features the Happy Hare TYPE-B solution, which enables efficient and reliable consumable switching to provide seamless support for your multicolor printing.

## Product Highlights:
 • Modular design: 3D printed shell and acrylic transparent window, both beautiful and practical.  
 • Efficient sealing: Optimized consumable sealing design can effectively prevent consumable moisture and contamination.  
 • Open source support: fully open source, community-driven, continuous improvement and innovation.  
 • Easy to integrate: Designed to be compatible with BigtreeTech MMB-Board (Beta), simplifying installation and configuration.

• Community Contribution: Join our community and share your ideas and suggestions for improvement.  
## How it works
KMS is an automatic consumables replacement system based on independent channels, which natively supports the Happy-Hare V3 software system and can run stably.  
The system integrates the temperature and humidity monitoring function to monitor the cabin environment in real time and provide accurate data reference for your consumables storage.   
Thanks to the independent channel design, KMS does not rely on selectors or servos, simplifying the control process while improving reliability.  
In order to optimize the synchronization of consumables between the KMS printing system and the printer, we have specially designed the KMS-Buffer system. This design ensures a smoother transfer of consumables between the printer end and the KMS.   
In addition, we have developed a modular motorized rewinder to help you recycle consumables quickly and reliably, reducing the risk of print interruptions.  
To get the most out of KMS, we recommend using BigTreeTech's dashboard system. Designed for Class B multicolor printing systems, this motherboard provides you with a complete product solution that ensures seamless integration and efficient operation.
## For best results
Software System (Happy-Hare)
KMS was developed in collaboration with the Happy-Hare V3 system to ensure seamless integration and efficient operation.   
For a detailed guide to installation and configuration, please visit the Happy-Hare repository for comprehensive installation information.  
### Hot End Cutting or Tip Forming?
• Hot End Tool Head Cutting: This is the most reliable and recommended solution for KMS. Please visit our database for the most up-to-date installation guides and instructions.  
• Tip Forming: If you can't cut with a tool head, you can also opt for the tip forming option. However, the effectiveness of this solution may vary depending on equipment, consumables, and other factors.  
In addition, in order to solve the problem of consumable embolization, we also specially designed the remote servo system cutter. This innovative design avoids clogging of consumables and ensures a smoother printing process.
